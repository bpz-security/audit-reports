# Not burning tokens from the all the address in a array due to hardcoded value

## Vulnerability details

It's hard coded to the 0th element in the addressesToWipe array in the restructureCapTable function. So it skips burning the tokens
from the rest of the address in the array. So the function does not work as expected.

## Proof of Concept
``` solidity 
309     function restructureCapTable(address[] calldata helpers, address[] calldata addressesToWipe) public {
310             require(zchf.equity() < MINIMUM_EQUITY);
311             checkQualified(msg.sender, helpers);
312             for (uint256 i = 0; i<addressesToWipe.length; i++){
313                 address current = addressesToWipe[0];
314                 _burn(current, balanceOf(current));
315             }
316      }
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-frankencoin/blob/main/contracts/Equity.sol#L313

Here you can see its hardcorded to 0th element in the for loop(line 313) .

## Tools Used
Manual Auditing

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
``` solidity
313     address current = addressesToWipe[i]; 
```

Use i instead of 0 so that its burned tokens from addresses which are in the addressesToWipe array.
